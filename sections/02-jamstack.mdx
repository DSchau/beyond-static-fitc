# Development has changed.

```notes
- What I hope to convey in this talk is simple: Development has changed
- By the end of this talk, I hope to make this clear
- The quicker you adapt to this new methodology, the better off you will be.

<Fit>JavaScript development has <em>never</em> been</Fit>
<Fit caps={true} color={colors.accent}>better.</Fit>

```notes
- If you call yourself a frontend, node, or JavaScript developers
- You can see this in the thriving ecosystem
- The surge of excellent, helpful libraries and frameworks
- Some have called this explosion JavaScript fatigue
- I prefer to think of it as a JavaScript Renaissance
- Change is scary, but change is also good.

## We'll come back to this.

<Fit>These are tools developers <em>want</em> to use.</Fit>

---

## But we can't.

### And this sucks.

### A lot.

> But we can't.

---

## This is changing.

---

## Excellent APIs are ubiqituous.

---

## Software as a Service = ðŸš€

### "Markup"

<Fit>JAMStack</Fit>

## `J`avascript
## `A`PIs
## `M`arkup

---

<Fit>This is...</Fit>
<Fit caps={true} color={colors.accent}>Fantastic</Fit>

---

## Developers can use the tools they want to use.

- âœ… React
- âœ… GraphQL
- âœ… Node.js

---

<Fit>Use the <em>best</em> services.</Fit>
<Fit>(and hey, less time spent re-implementing those services!)</Fit>

---

## Build UIs from these disparate, best-of-breed services and tools.

---

<Fit>But this also...</Fit>
<Fit caps={true} color={colors.accent}>kind of sucks.</Fit>

---

## Performance can _easily_ degrade

---

## Complex business logic to combine data sources

---

## Challenging to implement state-management

```notes
In a similar way that it's hard to manage performance with multiple APIs, it's also hard to:

- implement state management
- Merging these sources and keeping them in sync client-side is not a trivial task, whatsoever
