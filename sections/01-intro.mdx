In this talk, learn how Gatsby uses React and GraphQL to help you build apps that combine the performance and workflow benefits of static sites with the flexibility and power of server-driven sites, all in a modern dev stack!' />

```notes
- My name is Dustin Schau
- As you may imagine, today I'll be talking about moving beyond static
- with tools you may know and hopefully love: Gatsby, React, and GraphQL
- What I hope to make clear is that there has been a fundamental shift in how we build web applications
- The quicker you adapt to this shift, the better of your application is going to be
- Your users will be happier
- You can deliver features faster
- There's a real dollars and cents value for adapting to this mindeset
